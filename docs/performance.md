### How to generate export logs

SMART bulk export clients generate a standard log format that has interesting data about the timing of the export and how many resources were exported. (It holds no sensitive or personal data.)

All you have to do is run a bulk export using one of the SMART tools (bulk-data-client or cumulus-etl) and there should be a log.ndjson file sitting in the data folder, next to your other NDJSON files.
